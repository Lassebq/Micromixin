/**
 * Package for the implementation of annotations which are provided by micromixin-transformer,
 * even though they are unlikely to be supported among mainstream mixin implementations.
 *
 * <p>Note that the micromixin-backports artifact (also administered under the micromixin
 * umbrella) also provides a method of making use of these annotations when making use of
 * the spongeian mixin implementation (or a compatible fork). However micromixin-backports
 * generally needs to be provided by the respective platform, which generally is not the
 * case due to the relative infrequent use of the micromixin ecosystem in already
 * well established modding ecosystems.
