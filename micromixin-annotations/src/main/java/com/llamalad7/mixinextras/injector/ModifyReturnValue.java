/**
 * The {@link ModifyReturnValue} annotation allows to apply a function on the
 * return value of a method. More specifically, the mixin implementation will
 * call the modify return value handler with the original return value and
 * return the actual return value.
 *
 * <h3>Availability</h3>
 *
 * <p>This annotation is not available as-is on the spongeian mixin implementation
 * and is part of Llamalad7's MixinExtras. Please refer to your launcher
 * documentation for more details. Recent release of SLL's launcher-sponge
 * variant should come with MixinExtras already bundled by default.
 * However, as MixinExtras is widely used in the minecraft scene it is very
 * likely that your loader supports it, provided you are either using SLL or
 * a loader written for minecraft (such as neoforge or fabric).
 *
 * <h3>ModifyReturnValue versus Inject</h3>
 *
 * <p>Usage of {@link ModifyReturnValue} should be preferred over other
 * annotations such as {@link Inject} for it's supposed capability of being
 * easily and safely chained. In truth we do not see if that is really the case
 * under the micromixin-transformer implementation. Usage of
 *
 * <blockquote><code>
 * &#64;Inject(...)
 * private void handleCallback(CallbackInfoReturnable&lt;T&gt; cir) {
 *      cir.setReturnValue(apply(cir.getReturnValue()));
 * }
 * </code></blockquote>
 *
 * can and should be replaced with
 *
 * <blockquote><code>
 * &#64;ModifyReturnValue(...)
 * private T handleCallback(T original) {
 *      return apply(original);
 * }
 * </code></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Aside from the aforementioned improvements this annotations does not
 * (as seen above) allocate a {@link CallbackInfoReturnable} and is as such more performant.
 * It should as such be used in hot code whenever appropriate.
 * While the assumption that the CallbackInfoReturnable allocation will get
 * inlined or otherwise optimized in the JVM may be true, some JVMs might
 * not follow this and will show a notable performance gain when using
 * this annotation over {@link Inject}.
 *
 * <h3>Signature and visibility modifiers</h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@link ModifyReturnValue} handler (also known as the "return value modifier") MUST
 * declare the same return type (subtypes are not supported) as the return type of the targeted
 * method. If the targeted method is <code>static</code>, the handler MUST be <code>static</code>
 * and <code>private</code>. For non-<code>static</code> targets the access modifiers are
 * not of relevance, except for constructors where the handler must be <code>static</code> when
 * not injecting immediately before the final return via <code>TAIL</code>.
 *
 * <p>The handler should furthermore also have the original return type (supertypes are not supported)
 * as it's argument.
 *
 * <p>The value that is modified must be the first argument of the return value modifier handler
 * method. All other arguments are there for argument capture.
 *
 * <h3>Argument and local capture</h3>
 *
 * <p>At this point in time, local capture is not supported.
 *
 * <p>Argument capture behaves the same way as {@link ModifyConstant}. The arguments that can be captured
 * are the arguments with whom the target method was called with (do note that it is permissible for the
 * values to be reassigned - so while it guarantees the argument was captured, the value of the argument
 * may have been altered) - or more plainly, argument capture means that the arguments of the target method
 * are captured and passed to the return value modifier handler method.
 *
 * <p>Captured arguments must be defined in the same order as the target method.
 * It is not permissible to "skip" arguments, but it is permissible to not capture trailing arguments
 * - leading arguments need to be captured however under the premise of the "no skipping" requirement.
 *
 * <p>Reassigning captured arguments in the return value modifier method has no effect on the target method.
 * As such, the behaviour is quite similar to the argument and local variable capture behaviour of {@link Inject}.

     * what exactly went wrong.
     *
     * <p>The following are all valid formats of explicit target selectors:
     *
     * <ul>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod</code></li>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod(I)Lcom/example/ReturnValue;</code></li>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod()Z</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;targetMethod(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;targetMethod(Lcom/example/Argument;) V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;target Method(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;targetMethod(Lcom/exam ple/Argument;)V</code></li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The parts of the explicit target selector (owner, name, descriptor) must always have the same order,
     * but the individual parts must not necessarily be present.
     *
     * <p>While permissible, it is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> to make use of whitespace in explicit
     * target selectors. When they are used, the spongeian mixin implementation (and also micromixin) will
     * discard all whitespace characters (tabs included). This is documented behaviour (in both micromixin
     * and sponge's mixin) and is unlikely to change in the future. This discouragement exists as this feature
     * may cause target selectors to be illegible.
     *
     * <p>It is generally recommended to not be lazy when it comes to explicit selectors,
     * the more information is provided the better. Information that is not supplied is comparable
     * to a wildcard - the first matching method will be targeted, even if nonsense.
     * It is especially not recommended to discard the method name, even if that is theoretically valid.
     *
     * <p>The spongeian implementation also supports schemes other than the explicit selectors.
     * However the Micromixin implementation only supports explicit selectors as documented above.
     * Where as the spongeian implementation supports quantifiers in explicit selectors,
     * Micromixin does not support them (yet). As such, quantifiers are not included in the documentation.
     *
     * <p>MixinExtra does not support target matching via {@link Desc}. It is likely that this feature will never
     * be implemented by MixinExtra as the developer finds that feature superfluous. While the micromixin-transformer
     * does implement that feature regardless, making use of the feature would require a custom annotation library
     * for as long as Mixin implementations based on the spongeian mixin implementation remain viable
     * in the galimulator modding space and the strict interoperability between the implementations is needed.
