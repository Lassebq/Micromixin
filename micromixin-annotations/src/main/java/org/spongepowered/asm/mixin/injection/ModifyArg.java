/**
 * The {@link ModifyArg} annotation allows to apply a function on a single
 * argument used to call a method. More specifically, the mixin implementation
 * will call the argument modifier handler with the original argument value.
 * The handler will then return the modified value with whom the targeted method
 * is called with.
 *
 * <p>A single {@link ModifyArg} handler can only modify a single argument.
 * If multiple arguments are to be modified, multiple handlers are required.
 * Alternatively, different (as of yet unimplemented) annotations can be used,
 * for example ModifyArgs.
 *
 * <h3>Local variable use</h3>
 *
 * <p>The micromxin-transformer implementation tries to avoid usage of local variables
 * when using ModifyArg. However this is not always possible. For the target descriptor
 * (ICDLjava/lang/Object;I)V and an index of 2 the transformer will produce following bytecode:
 *
 * <blockquote><code>
 * ISTORE index0<br>
 * ASTORE index1<br>
 * DUP2_X2<br>
 * POP2<br>
 * ALOAD 0<br>
 * SWAP<br>
 * invokevirtual Clazz.handler(C)C<br>
 * DUP2_X2<br>
 * POP2<br>
 * ALOAD index1<br>
 * ILOAD index0<br>
 * invokeX Clazz.original(ICDLjava/lang/Object;I)V<br>
 * </code></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>While micromixin-transformer uses opcodes such as DUP or POP aggressively, the spongeian implementation
 * will use xSTORE/xLOAD everywhere.
 *
 * <h3>Signature and visibility modifiers</h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@link ModifyArg} handler (also known as the "argument modifier") MUST
 * declare the same return type (subtypes are not supported) as its argument
 * type (supertypes are not supported). If the targeted method is static, the handler MUST be static and private.
 * For non-static targeted methods the handler MUST NOT be static, but otherwise the accessibility
 * modifiers are not of relevance.
 
  <p>Locals and argument capture is not supported when using {@link ModifyArg}.

     * <p>The following are all valid formats of explicit target selectors:
     *
     * <ul>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod</code></li>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod(I)Lcom/example/ReturnValue;</code></li>
     *  <li><code>targetMethod()Z</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;targetMethod(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;targetMethod(Lcom/example/Argument;) V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;target Method(Lcom/example/Argument;)V</code></li>
     *  <li><code>Lcom/example/Target;targetMethod(Lcom/exam ple/Argument;)V</code></li>

     * <p>The parts of the explicit target selector (owner, name, descriptor) must always have the same order,
     * but the individual parts must not necessarily be present.
     *
     * <p>While permissible, it is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> to make use of whitespace in explicit
     * target selectors. When they are used, the spongeian mixin implementation (and also micromixin) will
     * discard all whitespace characters (tabs included). This is documented behaviour (in both micromixin
     * and sponge's mixin) and is unlikely to change in the future. This discouragement exists as this feature
     * may cause target selectors to be illegible.
     *
     * <p>It is generally recommended to not be lazy when it comes to explicit selectors,
     * the more information is provided the better. Information that is not supplied is comparable
     * to a wildcard - the first matching method will be targeted, even if nonsense.
     * It is especially not recommended to discard the method name, even if that is theoretically valid.
     *
     * <p>The spongeian implementation also supports schemes other than the explicit selectors.
     * However the Micromixin implementation only supports explicit selectors as documented above.
     * Where as the spongeian implementation supports quantifiers in explicit selectors,
     * Micromixin does not support them (yet). As such, quantifiers are not included in the documentation.
     *
     * <p>It is rather advisable to use {@link #target()} over {@link #method()}, especially for beginners,
     * since latter provides behaviour that can more easily be anticipated.
